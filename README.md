# Inventory Management System

- The inventory application is a desktop application built by JavaFX without a database.

- Application stores inventory data. Inventory has in-house and outsourced parts and products. Parts are associated with the products. The data collected for parts and products are name, price, number of available stock, min set number to order and max set number of the stocks. Users can create, update, and delete parts and products. Products can't be updated or deleted without handling associated parts first.
